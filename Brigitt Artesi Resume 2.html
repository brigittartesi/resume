                    Entering my final year of a dual Media (PR & Advertising) and International Studies degree at UNSW I have built upon my theoretical knowledge with practical experience as a marketing coordinator at Pallion. I am highly motivated in enhancing my digital abilities through developing new skills ranging from HTML and CSS to producing digital collateral on programs such as Canva and Sketchbook Pro.

                            Organised a campus tour for my peer mentor group as well as a scavenger hunt for first year students. A high degree of coordination had to go into what content I would deliver for our weekly meetings particularly when we collaborated with other peer mentor groups.

                            As I was all too aware of the emotions new first years would be experiencing I was able to create a positive environment where they felt comfortable discussing any concerns they had.
