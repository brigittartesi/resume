                    <p>
                        Completing my final year of a dual International Studies & Media
                        degree at UNSW I am constantly motivating myself to build upon
                        my creativity outside of an academic environment. My eagerness to
                        learn has allowed me to develop and offer skills ranging from HTML
                        to CSS, as well as the ability to produce collateral on programs such
                        as Canva and Sketchbook Pro. My experience in producing
                        marketing plans and ability to develop original content for social
                        media are proven in my time as the Marketing Coordinator with
                        Pallion. I am currently looking for a marketing internship with a
                        successful marketing team to further my skills.

                                implemented social media plans so as to manage current
